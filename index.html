    <h1>all about dogs</h1>
    <p>i love dogs because they are fun.dog are loyal.<br>
      
      they are interesting mammals that are descended from wolves<br>
      
      and have companions to humans for thousands of years.<br>
      
      so dogs are amazing and wonderful. they are also full of energy<br>
